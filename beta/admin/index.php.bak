file: admin/index.php
purpose: main index page for admin. Sets up error handling, header, db, action, page then performs action and/or renders page. Then closes db & includes footer

description: This page is the entry point for the application & all pages that do not load in a new window are rendered thru this page - the page 
			 is effectively the controller (in context of the application's design as MVC app & simplified implementation of that design): it manages
			 the control flow, session state maintenance etc...
			 The page functions as such:
			 	- begins by implementing session (session_start()) & setting cache control HTTP header to allow form values to be retained when browser back
			 	  button or javascript back link are used.
				- defines error handling functions - these are used to report system erros & forms that have not had all compulsory fields completed
				- the performAction function is then defined. The app uses the command pattern, with each command represented as an action class in the action
				  directory. Each action has an execute method - the action is defined as a hidden form field (occasionally as a querystring for delete links mainly)
				  and the appropriate action class is then searched for by the ActionFactory (_factories/_ActionFactory.php) class (factory pattern), instantiated and executed. The render page function
				  is also defined in this section of the script - again a factory class (_factories/_PageFactory.php) is utilised to instantiate the correct page class from its id (?page=);
				  the render page function then attempts to include the page from its filename
				- the header is then included (before anyhting that may cause an error so errors are handled gracefully)
				- database connection created and instantiated
				- the page id is then looked for and the PageFactory used to instanitate the appropriate page class
				- any required action is then looked for from HTTP POST or GET and performed as appropriate
				- page then rendered
				- db connection closed
				- footer included
