					<br><h2>Testimonials</h2>
                    <p>Thanks for a great website and prompt delivery! I have tried several website businesses and I always have to ring to follow up the order.  My order arrived on time as promised! Your website is fantastic and very easy to use... well done and good luck!
					<br><b>Kylie</b><br>
					<p>Love the website! Very clear and simple to use and move around!<br>
					Thanks<br>
					<strong>Simon</strong>
					<p>I can't believe how quickly I received my order! I placed my order on the Saturday and received it five days later on Thursday. I've never received a purchase over the net this fast! And I have to say what a brilliant web site you have. So precise but most of all, so easy to use. The labels 
					have come in very handy and I will most definitely order from you again. Thank you!<br>
					<b>Christine </b>
					<p>I found that your web site was the best that I have come across. I not only ordered some labels for my kids but for myself aswell! Congrats on a fab business!<br>
					<b>Lee </b><br>
					<p>Just had to email you to say how impressed I am with your product. I have recently purchased labels from another company over the net and waited 3 months for my labels to arrive! Decided to try you guys and found a great user friendly web site, ordering and payment system. Plus my order arrived in 10 days. Very impressed! As my oldest of 3 children is turning 4, I hope to enjoy your products for many years to come.<br>
					<strong>Vanessa</strong>
					<p>This is a good,clear, and well organised website and the labels are fantastic!!!!! <br>
					<strong>Helen </strong>
					<p>Fantastic products! The only ones that Ive tried that survive endless washing both in the machine and the sink! The shoe labels are great - they havent moved at all! Can honestly say that every label is still in place! My 2 1/2 yr old daughter loves finding her 'fairy' on all her things, which means everything finds its way home. Thanks for such a great and durable product! <br>
					<strong>Letitia </strong>
					<p> I have used identiKid lables since my first child was born 5 years ago. I still have some of his baby things with the lables on them that have not peeled or cracked and are still being used by my daughter. These are fun affordable and most importantly, durable and long lasting lables. I also love how easy it is to order.<br>
					Thank you!<br><strong>Julie</strong>
					<p>Thank you so much for the absolutely fantastic vinyl labels we ordered from identiKid - they look great on our daughter's things. We can stick them on everthing!!! Thank you again for an amazing product, we will be ordering many more in the future and telling all our friends about your superb service &amp; product range.<br>
					<strong>Nicky &amp; Hunter English.</strong>
					<p>I thank you for making sure we - the customers are satisfied - the sign of a truly professional business. If I was handing out customer service awards I would be sending you one!<br>
					<strong>Karen</strong>
					<p>I ordered and received my starter kit a while ago but have only just realised how fantastic it is since my son started school. Everyone comments on his dinosaur bag tag and he loves the fact that he can recognise his things all by himself. Beautiful, bright and hard wearing and don't cost the earth. What a wonderful Aussie product. Will be back for more when my daughter starts school!!!<br>
					<strong>Tanya</strong>
					<p>I recieved the 'Starter Pack' in the mail the other day. Firstly, it arrived earlier than expected, which was great. Secondly &amp; more importantly, it was fantastic. My son loves the bag tags. Thanks again for your help &amp; paitence when I was ordering &amp; once again 'Thanks' for the great product. I think I'm more excited about my son Cameron starting kindy now, than he is!<br>
					<strong>Donna</strong>
					<p>Thanks for the excellent service and the wonderful products. My girls love them. Now their cousins and friends are so keen to get some for themselves too!<br>
					<strong>Rebecca</strong>
					<p> Identi kid are fun &amp; convenient for labelling the kids' school things. I keep them in my pantry &amp; use them a lot.<br>
					<strong>Colette</strong>
					<p>I've placed my first order finally, if I knew how easy your web site would be, I would of done it months ago. Congratulation on an excellent website.<br>
					<strong>Del</strong>
					<p>Your products are fantastic. I ordered a starter's pack last year and it was fabulous. I have re-ordered again this year for a top-up supply as the labels I used last year are still going strong (in fact, they seem to outlast the items they were placed on!). When other parents comment on the bright, beautifully designed labels on my daughter's things, I tell them where to get some from. I am really impressed with your product, service and fast delivery and will keep spreading the news. Keep up the good work and thanks for a terrific product.<br>
					<strong>Nathalie</strong>
					<p>We have just ordered again and your website is brilliant! Our 2 girls love your labels and can never decide on which cute picture to use! Thanks for having such a great product.<br>
					<strong>Zoe</strong>
					<p>Congratulations on a fabulous product. I found the online ordering system a breeze and the labels have graced everything from drink bottles to gumboots to my son's wheelbarrow! A marvellous service, keep up the good work.<br>
					<strong>Marianne </strong>
					<p>Just wanted to let you know that I received my pack today in the mail. Thank you very much, I'm most impressed! I know that after browsing through Sydney's child and looking at all the different label providers that I chose the right one. My kids just love the bag tags!<br>
					Your website is great, and I liked the fact I could pay by DD. Thanks again<br>
					<strong>Marina</strong>
					<p>Thank you so much for the promptness of my delivieries, and the quality and presentation of the labels. They are fantastic, and we are using them already on our beach toys and drink bottles. The kids love them!<br>
					<strong>Tracey </strong>
					<p> I have ordered a couple of times from you website. I found it easy to do and I was not disappointed at all when the product arrived. Brilliant idea and makes my life a lot easier naming my daughters things for childcare!<br>
					<strong>Olivia</strong>
					<p>Just wanted to say excellent web site. Haven't ordered anything yet, just starting my research on products, prices etc but your web site has to be one of the cleanest and easiest ones to use I have come across.<br>
					<strong>Lisa </strong>
					<p>I just placed my first order. The web site was easy to find your way around and the ordering system was the easiest I've ever used. Well done on a great site!<br>
					<strong>Emma Davis<br>
					Busy Mother of 3 daughters (7yrs, 5yrs, 2.5yrs)</strong>
					<p>Just wanted to let you know that I ordered a starter pack about 3 years ago and they are still going strong. My lunch boxes and drink bottles died well before the labels ever will!   Congratulations on a fantastic product. I will definitely be back when I am   ready for my son&rsquo;s labels. And your website is amazing &ndash; so easy to use, professional and colourful and fun &ndash; my daughter had great fun choosing a different icon this time (about three times!!).<br>
