<P>Step A: </P>
<P>Lay your Wall Graphics kit on floor and plan how you would like to use them. Let them sit unrolled for&nbsp;a few&nbsp;hours. Once youâ€™ve decided your design layout, Cut each piece of the Wall Graphics&nbsp;out roughly around shape(this makes it easy to position), Remove backing paper and position onto wall.&nbsp;Apply carefully&nbsp;to a smooth, clean and dry surface.(Non teflon based paint) You can reposition it whilst clear sheet remains over graphic easily to get the perfect spot!</P>
<P>Step B: </P>
<P>Once you are pleased with how it looks, give each sticker a good rub over the entire surface with&nbsp;a credit card&nbsp; rubbing to edge of each graphic piece. Work from inside to outer edge to remove air and&nbsp;give correct&nbsp;adhesion. At this stage leave the clear protective cover over wall art until it is well rubbed.&nbsp;If you have rubbed the graphic correctly the&nbsp;cover sheet will let go of the graphic easily. Remove the cover sheet gently.</P>
<P>Step C:&nbsp;&nbsp;Now simply sit back, relax and admire your work! Show your child and friends how really clever you are! </P>
<P>Printed instruction come with each wall art pack!</P>
