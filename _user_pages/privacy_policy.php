<P><STRONG>2.1 Collection of Personal Information</STRONG><A name=2_1></A><BR>IdentiKid will only collect personal information that is necessary for one or more of its legitimate functions or activities.</P>
<P>IdentiKid will only collect information by lawful and fair means not in an unreasonably intrusive way.</P>
<P>At or before the time IdentiKid collects personal information from the subject of the information (or, if that is not practical, as soon as practicable thereafter), identiKid will take reasonable steps to ensure that the subject of the information is aware of:</P>

<P>Where providing access would reveal evaluative information generated within IdentiKid in connection with a commercially sensitive- decision making process, IdentiKid may give the individual an explanation for the decision rather than direct access to the information.</P>

The review will be undertaken by personnel other than the original decision maker.</P>
<P>Wherever direct access by the individual is impractical or inappropriate, identiKid and the individual should consider whether the use of mutually agreed intermediaries would allow sufficient access to meet the needs of both parties.</P>
